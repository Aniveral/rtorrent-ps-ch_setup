Limited magnet link support
===========================

.. contents:: **Contents**


The problem
---------------------

Magnet links are really problematic with ``rtorrent``, just to name a few:

* actual meta file can't be downloaded from other clients of only encrypted connection is allowed

* created meta file by ``rtorrent`` is invalid (that means it can't be used to determine the size of the torrent with ``lstor``)

Although sometimes it still can be useful to grab something via magnet links.


Solution
--------

* requires ``rTorrent-PS-CH v1.4-0.9.6`` or newer (includes a new command ``d.is_meta`` in ``rtorrent``)

* they can't be used with ``queue`` script (created meta file by ``rtorrent`` is invalid), so there's only manual support for them

* use ``addMagnetLink.sh`` script that will create ``magnet torrent file`` from ``Magnet URI`` into one of the watch directories (categories) (one of the subdirs of ``.downloading`` dir) with the help of ncursed dialog for category selection

Usage: ``addMagnetLink.sh "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:foobar..."``


Final note
----------

Torrents created in this way:

* can't be picked up by the ``queue`` script: check available disk space manually before adding one (if there isn't enough then free up some) 

* won't be deleted by the ``queue`` script, no matter what category they are: you have to manage them manually
